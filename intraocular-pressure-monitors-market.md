<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Pressure Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Monitors</li><li>Non-Contact Monitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraocular Pressure Monitors are essential tools for detecting glaucoma and other eye conditions. The market is divided into two main types: Contact Monitors and Non-Contact Monitors. Contact Monitors, often involving devices like tonometers, measure pressure through direct contact with the eye, providing accurate readings. Non-Contact Monitors, such as air puff tonometers, utilize a puff of air to measure pressure without touching the eye, offering a more comfortable experience. Both types play a crucial role in routine eye examinations and patient management.</p></p>
