<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dispersing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Molecular-Weight</li><li>Low-Molecular-Weight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dispersing agent market is classified into two main types based on molecular weight: high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight dispersing agents. High-molecular-weight dispersing agents, characterized by larger polymer chains, provide excellent stabilization and viscosity control, making them ideal for coatings and heavy-duty applications. In contrast, low-molecular-weight dispersing agents, with shorter chains, offer rapid dispersion and lower viscosity, suitable for applications requiring quick processing, such as inks and paints. Both types play vital roles in ensuring uniform particle distribution in various industrial formulations.</p></p>
