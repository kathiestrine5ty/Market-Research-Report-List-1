<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Energy Recovery Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Type</li><li>Integrated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HVAC Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) market comprises two main types: independent and integrated systems. Independent type ERVs function as standalone units, optimizing air exchange by recovering energy from exhaust air to pre-condition incoming fresh air. This makes them suitable for various environments needing ventilation without altering existing HVAC systems. Conversely, integrated type ERVs are built directly into HVAC systems, enhancing overall efficiency by synchronizing air exchange and energy recovery, resulting in improved indoor air quality and reduced energy consumption.</p></p>
