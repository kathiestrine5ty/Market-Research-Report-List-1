<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intubation Scopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Intubation Scopes</li><li>Flexible Intubation Scopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intubation scopes are essential tools in airway management, classified into two main types: rigid and flexible. Rigid intubation scopes are characterized by their firm structure, providing a stable platform for visualization during procedures but may be less adaptable to anatomical variations. Flexible intubation scopes, on the other hand, offer maneuverability and enhanced access to difficult-airway situations by bending and navigating through anatomical curves. Both types cater to different clinical scenarios, enhancing patient care during intubation procedures.</p></p>
