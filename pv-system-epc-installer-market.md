<p><strong>The PV System EPC Installer Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid</li><li>Off-grid/On-grid</li><li>On-grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PV system EPC installer market encompasses three key applications: off-grid, off-grid/on-grid, and on-grid systems. Off-grid systems operate independently, providing energy in remote areas without utility access, ideal for residential and rural uses. Off-grid/on-grid systems combine self-sufficiency with grid connectivity, allowing users to utilize solar power when available and draw from the grid when needed. On-grid systems are directly tied to the utility grid, enabling users to sell excess energy back, promoting sustainable energy solutions and reducing electricity costs.</p></p>
