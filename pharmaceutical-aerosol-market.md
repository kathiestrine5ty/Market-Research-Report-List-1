<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Aerosol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metered Dose Inhaler</li><li>Dry Powder Inhaler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pharmaceutical aerosol market primarily includes Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) and Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs). MDIs deliver a specific dose of medication in aerosol form, often using propellants for effective lung delivery. They are widely used for conditions like asthma and COPD. In contrast, DPIs utilize the patient's inhalation to disperse medication, offering a breath-activated delivery mechanism. Both types ensure targeted therapy, but differ in formulation, patient ease of use, and specific applications in respiratory care.</p></p>
