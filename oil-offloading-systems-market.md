<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Offloading Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CBM (Conventional Buoy Mooring)</li><li>SPM (Single Point Mooring)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil offloading systems facilitate the transfer of crude oil from vessels to offshore facilities. Two primary types are Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM) and Single Point Mooring (SPM). CBM involves mooring ships to a buoy anchored to the seabed, allowing for flexible vessel positioning. SPM, on the other hand, employs a single point mooring system that accommodates larger tankers and allows for easier navigation in rough seas. Both systems enhance operational efficiency in offloading oil from offshore production sites.</p></p>
