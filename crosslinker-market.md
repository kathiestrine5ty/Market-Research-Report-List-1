<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crosslinker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Crosslinker</li><li>Inner Crosslinker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crosslinker market comprises two main types: external and internal crosslinkers. External crosslinkers are added to a polymer system during processing, enhancing the final product's properties such as mechanical strength and thermal stability. They often require specific conditions to react. Internal crosslinkers, on the other hand, are embedded within the polymer matrix, reacting during polymerization. This integration typically results in improved performance characteristics, such as chemical resistance and durability, without the need for additional processing steps. Both types are crucial for various industrial applications.</p></p>
