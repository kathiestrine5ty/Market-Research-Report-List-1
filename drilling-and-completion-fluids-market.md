<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drilling and Completion Fluids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based fluids</li><li>Oil-based fluids</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drilling and completion fluids market is categorized into three main types. Water-based fluids are primarily composed of water and additives, offering cost efficiency and environmentally friendly properties. Oil-based fluids, on the other hand, use oil as the base, providing superior lubrication and stability in complex formations, though at a higher cost and environmental concern. The "other" category includes synthetic fluids and hybrid systems, which combine features of both water and oil-based fluids to optimize performance and adaptability in various drilling conditions.</p></p>
