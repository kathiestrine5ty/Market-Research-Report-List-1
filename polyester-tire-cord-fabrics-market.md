<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Tire Cord Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipped</li><li>Undipped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyester tire cord fabrics are essential for reinforcing tires, available primarily in two types: dipped and undipped. Dipped fabrics undergo a chemical treatment that enhances adhesion between the cord and rubber, improving tire performance and durability. They are typically used in high-performance tires. In contrast, undipped fabrics are untreated, offering a cost-effective solution for standard tires where maximum adhesion is less critical. Both types cater to different segments of the tire industry, balancing performance and cost considerations.</p></p>
